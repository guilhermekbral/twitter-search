Twitter search project.
Right now we have a simple application that let you search for tweets. 20 tweets, mixed between recents and popular, will be shown.

Next steps:
- Add specs for the service
- Improve the view, making it prettier.
- work with ajax.
- Add number of tweets that the user wants returned, and add pagination based on number of choice.
